## 👋 Hi, I'm Samuel Akabassi

🎓 I am currently a **Master’s student in Software Engineering**.

💡 I am particularly interested in:
- ⚙️ **Embedded Systems**
- 🌐 **IoT**
- 🤖 **Artificial Intelligence**

📚 At the moment, I am learning **machine learning** and experimenting with **embedded systems** through small projects and simulations.

🛠️ Some of my embedded experiments are available on Wokwi:  
👉 https://wokwi.com/makers/akabassijgos

🔀 From time to time, I also work on projects outside these areas, mainly to explore new concepts or strengthen my fundamentals.
